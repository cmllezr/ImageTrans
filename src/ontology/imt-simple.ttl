The official OBI definition, explaining the meaning of a class or property: 'Shall be Aristotelian, formalized and normalized. Can be augmented with colloquial definitions'  is terrible.

Can you fix to something like:

A statement of necessary and sufficient conditions explaining the meaning of an expression referring to a class or property.

Alan Ruttenberg

Your proposed definition is a reasonable candidate, except that it is very common that necessary and sufficient conditions are not given. Mostly they are necessary, occasionally they are necessary and sufficient or just sufficient. Often they use terms that are not themselves defined and so they effectively can't be evaluated by those criteria. 

On the specifics of the proposed definition:

We don't have definitions of 'meaning' or 'expression' or 'property'. For 'reference' in the intended sense I think we use the term 'denotation'. For 'expression', I think we you mean symbol, or identifier. For 'meaning' it differs for class and property. For class we want documentation that let's the intended reader determine whether an entity is instance of the class, or not. For property we want documentation that let's the intended reader determine, given a pair of potential relata, whether the assertion that the relation holds is true. The 'intended reader' part suggests that we also specify who, we expect, would be able to understand the definition, and also generalizes over human and computer reader to include textual and logical definition. 

Personally, I am more comfortable weakening definition to documentation, with instructions as to what is desirable. 

We also have the outstanding issue of how to aim different definitions to different audiences. A clinical audience reading chebi wants a different sort of definition documentation/definition from a chemistry trained audience, and similarly there is a need for a definition that is adequate for an ontologist to work with."""@en ,

From the second IAO workshop, various comments, [commented on by Alan Ruttenberg 8/6/2009]

unit of measure is a quality, e.g. the length of a ruler.

[We decided to hedge on what units of measure are, instead talking about measurement unit labels, which are the information content entities that are about whatever measurement units are. For IAO we need that information entity in any case. See the term measurement unit label]

[Some struggling with the various subflavors of is_about. We subsequently removed the relation represents, and describes until and only when we have a better theory]

a represents b means either a denotes b or a describes

describe:
a describes b means a is about b and a allows an inference of at least one quality of b

We have had a long discussion about denotes versus describes."""@en ,
                                """From the second IAO workshop: An attempt at tieing the quality to the measurement datum more carefully.

a is a magnitude means a is a determinate quality particular inhering in some bearer b existing at a time t that can be represented/denoted by an information content entity e that has parts denoting a unit of measure, a number, and b.

Second, characteristic of is a functional property. Thus, two triples SDC_1 characteristc of IC_1 and SDC_2  characteristc of Process_1 (where IC_1 participates in Process_1), cannot exist simultaneously. 
An example of such case can be \"Temperature of during the annealing process was 1000°C\". Temperature is an SDC of some participant of the annealing, however it is not clear whether it is an SDC of an oven or of a sample in the oven.
